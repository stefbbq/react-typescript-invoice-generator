#Invoice Generator

## Notes on the project

- This project was built with React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Uses SASS with CSS modules, though there are some global rules - and all of the vendor prefixing stuff is handled by Create React App!
- Uses Bootstrap's pretty awesome layout mixins and a few of it's rules
- Uses Material UI and icons for a few controls
- Uses TypeScript, because TypeScript is great

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run `npm i && npm start` to serve the app and visit http://localhost:3000 to see it.

_Note: Create React App likes you to use Yarn, but you can still run the above commands just as well!_
